# lwn1.0-evaluation
Manual evaluation and refinement of the Latin WordNet by Stefano Minozzi.

## Introduction

The Latin WordNet (a.k.a. Latin WordNet 1.0) was created by Stefano Minozzi following the _Expand_ or _Extend Model_, that is, by translating the synsets of the English and Italian WordNets into equivalent synsets in Latin with the help of bilingual dictionaries. While generally effective, this automatic translation process produced some inaccurate lemma-synset assignments.

Here we provide a manually-verified version of Latin WordNet 1.0 with:
1. lemma-synset corrections;
2. consolidation of Classical Latin vocabulary and senses using the Lewis & Short and Oxford Latin Dictionaries as lexicographical references.

This **ongoing evaluation** represents the first step towards the development of a Latin WordNet 2.0 (a collaborative project between the University of Exeter and CIRCSE), which will include a larger lexical basis.

## Evaluation guidelines

The evaluation consists in manually reading through the `lemma-synsets.csv` and `synset-lemmas.csv` files in this repository ensuring that all lemma-synset assignments are correct and that no Classical Latin sense is missing.
